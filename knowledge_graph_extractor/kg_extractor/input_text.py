        "article_0" : """Techcombank's Auto-Earning feature revolutionizes banking

        Three months after Techcombank's Auto-Earning feature on its mobile e-banking app was introduced in January, its slogan - "Let your money work" - has become a social media trend in Vietnam.

        Techcombank’s focus on meeting the needs of retail customers is evident in its growth strategy in recent years. Last year, the bank attracted around 2.6 million new customers, the highest in its history. By March 2024, the bank’s total number of retail customers had reached 13.8 million. 

        Focusing on retail services

        Notably, Techcombank’s customers are engaging with a broader spectrum of the bank’s services. On average, customers are using four to five services, compared to one or two services in the past. This has propelled Techcombank’s retail segment forward, establishing it as the primary transaction bank for its customers and fueling its sustained growth since 2006.

        “As early as 7 a.m, many customers use Techcombank's code to book a taxi or use points to redeem a coffee or buy breakfast. When they need to buy something for lunch, they use Techcombank's card or other payment solutions. In the evening, when they go shopping or engage with friends and relatives, they have Techcombank Rewards points for vouchers at stores, restaurants, and entertainment venues. This warms my heart,” said Techcombank’s Chief Retail Banking Group Officer Nguyen Anh Tuan. 

        Techcombank pioneered the “zero fee - free e-banking money-transfer policy” in September 2016, which drove forward the banking industry’s digital transformation and championed the adoption of cashless payments. The move resulted in a quick spread of a “zero fee” policy throughout the entire Vietnamese banking market, which has benefited Vietnamese customers nationwide.

        In January 2024, Techcombank introduced another breakthrough offering, the Auto-Earning feature on its mobile e-banking app. With a simple one-time activation, customers’ idle cash in their primary account earns optimal returns at a highly competitive rate of 3.1% per annum (depending on prevailing policies at the time), while remaining liquid and accessible for transactions when needed. 

        This feature enhances convenience for customers, automatically earns them profit on their idle cash, and is delivered through a seamless digital banking experience.

        The Zero Fee policy and Auto Earning feature align with a broader objective of Techcombank: advancing towards a cashless society and revolutionizing digital banking. 

        Achieving this objective was supported with a substantial investment of US$300 million in technology infrastructure in the period of 2016-2020 (excluding human resources costs). 

        Techcombank has allocated a further US$500 million to technology investment under its 5-year strategy in the 2021-2025 period. The capital is being used to spearhead new projects and drive digital transformation, enhancing its competitiveness in the market.

        "We hope customers always see Techcombank as a trusted companion in every step of their financial lives. With Auto-Earning, Techcombank's mobile app becomes a financial assistant in their pocket, helping customers multiply their funds effortlessly,” said Nguyen Anh Tuan.

        Auto-earning for all customers 

        Tuan revealed that prior to the official launch of Auto Earning in January 2024, the project team dedicated 18 months to designing, testing, and gathering feedback on the new feature. This enabled the project team to make necessary design adjustments and restructure the customer journey and the feature’s functionality before it was launched.

        “If you do something without a specific direction or vision, it will be stressful. But when you have a firm belief that once you roll out the feature, customers will love it and benefit from it, and it is no longer a pressure. It becomes motivation,” Nguyen Anh Tuan said. 

        “We had to identify which features needed to be improved for Auto Earning to provide the best convenience and support to our customers. Next, we engaged with customers through various interactive channels to get their feedback and assess their needs while using the application. Based on this insight, the bank continued to make necessary adjustments to ensure the most seamless customer experience possible,” he added.

        During the research and testing phase of Auto Earning, internal pressure was immense. According to Tuan, Auto Earning was a key project prioritized by Techcombank’s Board of Directors, leading to additional financial and human resources being allocated to the project. This desire to deliver a new breakthrough product for customers extended beyond the direct project team, inspiring all management levels and the entire company. 

        The Board of Directors faced the challenging task of balancing this desire to create a unique customer value proposition with the need to ensure other areas of the business continued to thrive. 

        In many countries, the Auto Earning feature is very popular, often referred to as the Auto Sweeping Facility. Implementing such a feature requires methodological investment in product features and technological infrastructure to ensure seamless convenience, enhanced user experience, and numerous benefits for customers. 

        In this regard, Techcombank stands out as a trailblazer in introducing this innovation to customers in Vietnam.

        “At Techcombank, we consistently prioritize meeting the needs of our customers, placing them at the heart of everything we do. With this new feature, customers can enjoy enhanced efficiency in time management and cash flow,” said Nguyen Anh Tuan.

        “Techcombank’s exceptional performance can be attributed to our steadfast adherence to the core cultural value of the 'Customer is the focus'across all business endeavors,” he added.

        A “long-lasting fortune”

        The decision to launch the Auto-Earning feature just before the 2024 Lunar New Year (Tet holiday) has an intriguing backstory. Tuan recalled that the project team had confidence in the new product, but it was impossible to be certain it was perfect. 

        Understandably, while this feature took 18 months to develop, it was only tested on small groups of selected customers. Meanwhile, Techcombank’s mobile app is used by many millions of customers every day. Nonetheless, the management team of Techcombank opted to activate Auto Earning during the Tet holiday, aiming to usher in “a new year of luck and lasting fortune” for customers. 

        After only three months, the Auto-Earning slogan - “Let your money work” - has become a social media trend in Vietnam. 

        Thanks to its unique value proposition, it has attracted nearly 500,000 registered users, propelling Techcombank back to the top in CASA, with a ratio of 40.5% and a NIM of 4% at the end of March 2024. Buoyed by the success of this feature, Techcombank aims to attract two million new customers in 2024.

        Nguyen Anh Tuan, a highly experienced manager that has been with the bank for over 18 years, attributes its success to its ability to change and progress through investment in digitalization and by attracting the best talent. 

        Techcombank’s market-leading application of digital technology and data analysis enables the bank to gain deeper insights into customer needs and preferences. These insights, coupled with its strong customer-centric approach, empower the bank to deliver unique customer value propositions and experiences tailored to the unique needs of individual customers.   

        However, technology on its own is not enough. Techcombank boasts over 11,000 employees that include Vietnamese and international talent. Its team comprises 18 different nationalities, all united in their commitment to delivering the best experience possible for customers and to fullfilling the bank’s vision of “Change banking, Change lives.”

        “We hope that as we understand customers better, our solutions, especially unsecured lending solutions based on convenience, speed, timing and suitability for customers, will be the next products that make a difference, enriching the convenience that we offer,” Tuan said.

        According to reports at Techcombank’s 2024 General Meeting of Shareholders, the bank’s total investment in technology for the 2021-2025 period amounts to US$500 million. Techcombank has made significant strides towards its goal of becoming an AI-driven bank, harnessing the power of data to enhance business value. The bank’s data system is structured into 100 micro-segments, with a focus on achieving personalized experiences for each customer. Furthermore, more than 52 million individual financial analyses have been conducted, resulting in improved conversion rates for targeted campaigns."""

        Commenting on the success, the nation’s leading private bank said that a focus on meeting the needs of retail customers has been intrinsic to its growth strategy in recent years.

        At the end of Q1/ 2024, the number of the bank's retail customers reached 13.8 million. In 2023, it attracted a record 2.6 million new customers.

        The bank also noted that the increase in the number of retail customers has been accompanied by greater engagement with a broader spectrum of its services, from 1-2 earlier to an average of 4-5 at present.

        This indicated that the retail customers’ primary banking relationship is with Techombank, a factor fuelling its sustained growth since 2006, according to Nguyen Anh Tuan, chief retail banking group officer.

        “As early as 7 a.m., many customers use Techcombank's code to book a taxi or use points to redeem a coffee or buy breakfast. When they need to buy something for lunch, they use Techcombank's card or other payment solutions. In the evening, when they go shopping or engage with friends and relatives, they use Techcombank Rewards points for vouchers at stores, restaurants, and entertainment venues. This warms my heart,” Tuan said.

        Techcombank marked itself as a pioneer in the Vietnamese banking industry in September 2016, when it introduced the “Zero Fee - Free E-banking Money-Transfer Policy,” propelling the industry’s digital transformation and championing the adoption of cashless payments.

        Both “Zero Fee” and “Auto Earning” features align with the bank’s broader objective of advancing towards a cashless society and revolutionizing digital banking.

        Pursuit of this objective has been supported by a substantial investment of $300 million in technology infrastructure from 2016 to 2020 (excluding human resource costs).

        Thorough preparation

        Tuan revealed that prior to the official launch of “Auto Earning” in January 2024, the project team dedicated 18 months to designing, testing and constantly gathering feedback on the new feature.

        This enabled the team to make necessary design adjustments and even restructure the customer journey and the feature’s functionality before it was ready for launch, he said.

        Hồng Thắm
        
        14:56, Thu Mar 20, 2025 (GMT+7)

        As a bank that is always a pioneer in technology and leading digital trends, Techcombank is creating a new trend in digital experience.

        The strong development of technology has led to increasingly high customer expectations for financial products. The digital banking experience today does not stop at convenience, speed, and safety, but must also suit each user portrait.

        Banks lead the trend

        Techcombank is still known as a "Tend creating bank" thanks to its strongly invested technology platform, especially in digital experience.

        A typical example, in 2016, this bank, one of the most effective banks in Vietnam, implemented Zero Fee, creating a "seismic" in the market when it exempted all fees for customers using Techcombank's digital banking service, even though at that time the service fee could be up to thousands of billions of VND and was a large source of revenue for banks. For a while, a series of other banks have also applied, and up to now, almost all banks in Vietnam no longer collect fees.

        Or in January 2024, Techcombank was the first bank in Vietnam to deploy "Autumn profits" - paying high interest rates for idle money to have the Automatic profits feature enabled in the payment account. The "revolution" created by Techcombank has attracted nearly 3 million more customers after more than a year of launch, helping nearly 80,000 billion VND of customers optimize benefits.

        After more than a year, up to now, a series of banks have also implemented paying interest on accounts similar to the "Autumn Profit" version of Techcombank in the early stages, but with different names, as the "era of free transactions" in Vietnam was created from Techcombank's initiative.

        However, customers always constantly expect improvement, especially in terms of experience. This has prompted Techcombank to launch version 2.0 of Automatic sinh after only 01 year and more completely optimize the customer experience thanks to its convenient, absolutely seamless features with a processing speed of only 1 second for every transaction and payment on all channels without any restrictions.

        According to banking and financial experts, Automatic profit generation is not just a trend but could be a new standard, a revolution in the banking industry. Continuously innovating to enhance the experience, the bank can change customers' thinking about a completely new financial product, bringing more value to customers like Apple's way of refreshing the phone, making the Iphone a symbol of the world.

        Automatic language development sets new standards

        "Automatic profit" is a product of Techcombank but has attracted the rapid participation of many banks and the support of millions of customers, thereby setting new standards for financial products, including:

        Flexibly use all your account balances 24/7 while your money is optimized for yields:

        The special feature of Automatic Profit is flexibility. With just 01 click, customers no longer have to worry about what to choose to optimize the yield for idle money, everything is completely automatically set up so that the account always achieves the highest yield, up to 4%/year. Unlike allowing customers to only use a part of their account balance for certain time frames, Techcombank's 2.0 Automatic Profit version has just been launched, allowing customers to flexibly use all their account balances for all transactions such as payment, transfer or withdrawal 24/7 anytime, anywhere.

        The automatic transfer system ensures uninterrupted spending demand. While the current version of some banks will only allow customers to use a part of their account balances for certain time frames. At the same time, instead of the amount of 10 million VND or more for regular customers and over 100 million VND for priority customers who are new to " make a profit", with "Automatic profits" 2.0 have optimized all the money in the account, erasing all gaps to the threshold for profit. All of the customers' idle money is profitable, even for just 1 day.

        Change your habits in financial management: When customers tend to keep money in their accounts for longer, they will generate more returns from idle money. This encourages customers to keep money in their accounts instead of withdrawing for unnecessary expenses, because the higher the balance, the greater the profit. In addition, customers also avoid spending wastefully, thereby building a better financial habit.

        With Techcombank's system, the balance in the account is automatically filtered and the "surplus" is transferred to the "interest space" for profit, while still ensuring that customers can spend at any time. This creates a smart savings habit, where customers do not need to proactively deposit savings but can still optimize profits from idle money.

        Outstanding digital experience: With just one operation, customers will easily manage profits right on the app, can receive interest every day and track the profits generated. This also encourages customers to use more digital banking services, from checking balances, monitoring profits, to making payment transactions. With the Automatic Profit version 2.0, Techcombank has continuously improved and has had a breakthrough solution with a monthly interest payment mechanism to help customers easily track the yield from idle money in a simple, intuitive way. The fact that nearly 3 million new customers have been added, more than half of which come from digital channels, and nearly 15 million Techcombank users are participating in the current "Automatic Profit Era" is the clearest proof.

        One initiative - many values

        Automatic profit making not only helps this bank grow quickly, but also brings many values to customers, the banking industry as well as the whole society.

        For customers, the fact that many people have turned on Autumn Profit and encouraged other banks to join in and implement it shows that this product is truly attractive and brings practical benefits.

        For the banking industry, Automatic profits encourage customers to use digital channels instead of traditional transactions at the counter, helping banks reduce operating costs, optimize resources and move towards a modern banking model. In addition, it also promotes competition between banks, thereby creating increasingly superior products for users.

        As for the whole society, it is clear that in the current 4.0 era, financial products and services are increasingly optimized and bring better benefits and experiences, so users coming to digital banking is always a top priority. This contributes significantly to promoting cashless payments in society and soon completing the cashless payment target set by the Government.

        Pioneering in providing innovative financial products such as "Autumn profits" also helps Techcombank affirm its position as a leading bank in innovation, enhancing its reputation in the industry."""
